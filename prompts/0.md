## Goal:
Scaffold an Expo-first AI Journaling app repo that matches the attached architecture diagram.

## Context:
- Architecture modules: Context Reader, Question Validator, Question Engine Orchestrator (question DB + follow-up generator + new question generator), Extractor, Advisor, ME Database (Profile/State/Patterns/Trust Calibration), and (later) External Context (Calendar + Email metadata).
- We need a mobile app + a backend endpoint layer for LLM calls (no secrets in the client).

## Constraints:
- Use Expo + TypeScript + expo-router.
- Keep dependencies minimal.
- Include an in-app “mock AI mode” (Settings toggle) so the UI works before backend is wired.
- Cloud-first: store all journaling data in Supabase Postgres; local storage only for short-lived drafts.
- Require sign-in from day one (Supabase Auth).
- Store both raw journal text and derived summaries.
- All source code must live under `src/` (including routes).
- Add AGENTS.md, docs/architecture.md, and docs/prompts-runtime.md.
- Create a clean folder structure that supports parallel development without file conflicts.

## Deliverables:
1) Expo app scaffold with routes:
   - /onboarding
   - /journal
   - /history
   - /settings
2) A data layer with interfaces for:
   - JournalEntry, JournalSession, AIQuestion, DailySummary, WeeklyPattern, MeProfile, MeState, MePatterns, TrustCalibration
3) A “Question Engine Orchestrator” service in code (stubbed) with:
   - getNextQuestion()
   - validateQuestionAnswered()
4) A “Extractor” service in code (stubbed) that produces structured JSON output
5) A backend folder scaffold (Supabase Edge Function placeholder OR a simple local Node service) with a single endpoint:
   POST /ai/runPipeline  (accepts draft + me context; returns {nextQuestion, extractedSummary, advice})

## Acceptance criteria:
- App runs and you can navigate all screens.
- You can type a journal entry, request “Next Question”, and “Complete” a session.
- History shows saved entries (even if summaries are mock data).
- Code is formatted, typed, and modular.

## Verification:
- Provide commands to run the app and confirm routes work.
- Run lint/typecheck if configured.

## Files expected to change:
New repo scaffold; do not add advanced features (auth, calendar/email) yet.
